# city_tours

This project was created during the ML Kit Hackathon and can be continued.
It was meant to be a touristic app which leads tourists through the city.

1. Choose a tour.
2. Find the first sight.
3. Once found make a photo and send it to the Cloud Vision API.
4. If the Cloud Vision API returns the expected sight name, this part of the challenge is successfully finished.
5. The next sight has to be found or the tour finishes.

Done: 
* The Cloud Vision API has been successfully tested
* The camera image can be taken and send to the Cloud Vision API

Todo:
* The whole user flow and design has to be implemented
* The currently retrieved image is only a thumbnail
* See issues for more details
